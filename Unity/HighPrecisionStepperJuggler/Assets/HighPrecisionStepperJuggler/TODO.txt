

[ ] fix ball position spawning every frame (bad performance impact)
[X] figure out whether or not velocity data is reliable
[X] change plate to octagon (import new model data).
[X] update CAD data to reflect new plate design.

[ ] fix runtime error that occurs when no camera is connected.
[ ] Write latex math file

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523

memo:

[X] automatic switching through the streams on startup?
    [X] create the TimeLineCoordinator class
    [X] UniRx might help to make things cleaner?
    
[X] refactor the TiltMeterPresenter

[ ] Maybe start with z data only and fade in other things later
    [ ] make the grid...
    [ ] ...xy position data stream...
    [ ] ...z position data stream...
    [ ] ...and target seperately fadable by sharedMaterial
    [ ] seperate remaining color materials in preparation for
    
[ ] animate coordinate system with a new timeAnimator class (also animate data time axis scale (x10/x100))
    
[ ] get a good routine going

[ ] animate camera
    [ ] implement smooth camera moves with set positions

[ ] fix 2-step bouncing stuck in up position on controlStrategySwitch
     [ ] end position should be down. But it ends up being stuck up      
     
[ ] circle bouncing with moving PID target
    
[ ] "every bounce will be a bit higher"-bouncing
[ ] back forth bouncing
[ ] left right bouncing
[ ] bring ball to halt by catching it softly.   





[ ] add radar style turning radius with fade to ball position visualization

[ ] make it possible to show data of second ball

[ ] 2 ball bouncing
    [ ] implemented code needed for this
    [ ] might be possible with Continuous2StepBouncingLow
    [ ] add ball 2 ball data
    [ ] add ball 2 ball data visualization
    [ ] bounce A -> just correct B -> just correct A -> bounce B -> just correct A -> just correct B -> bounce A?
    
[ ] add hit position heatmap
[ ] freeze datapoint-stream on ball data used by PID?
[ ] maybe hit ball without upwards motion when the ball moves very fast to get it under control faster.

[ ] maybe add a circleness check and discard detected object with a low circleness 
    Not really needed since there's normally not much noise in the video stream. But it'd be a nice to have.
    Just in case. Or for demos where there's a hand showing.

[ ] make radius result of image processing more precise (results differ from center to edge)

[X] check whether or not the tilt is constant when moving up with tilted plate
    [ ] turns out we DO have a problem with the tilt shifting ever so slightly while moving upwards with a tilted plate


// vid:
[ ] front view, change to unity graphics, look around, ent up in top view, change to realtime video again (top view)
[ ] start with short flex, then throwing ball onto machine
[ ] get rid of 1 ball by tossing it to the side after doing 2-ball-bouncing for a while
[ ] first half: bouncing patterns and data visualization
[ ] second half: bouncing patterns (again) with close up footage and in game camera changes (top view, motor close up view, + maybe one more view)
