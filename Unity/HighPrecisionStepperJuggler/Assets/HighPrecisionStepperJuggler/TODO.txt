[X] circle bouncing with moving control target
    [ ] use improved two-step bouncing to make sure that the machine uses the new target when moving down.
    [ ] test circle bouncing 

[ ] check if we're happy with the graph animations
    
[ ] fix ball position spawning every frame (bad performance impact)

[ ] animate camera
    [ ] implement smooth camera moves with set positions
    
[ ] show current control algorithm (maybe)
[ ] add x10/x100 somewhere
    
[ ] come up with new flex
[ ] get a good routine going
    
[ ] bring ball to halt by catching it softly.   
[ ] "every bounce will be a bit higher"-bouncing
[ ] zig-zag bouncing

// vid:
[ ] front view, change to unity graphics, look around, end up in top view, change to realtime video again (top view)
[ ] first half: bouncing patterns and data visualization
[ ] second half: bouncing patterns (again) with close up footage and in game camera changes (top view, motor close up view, + maybe one more view)
[ ] give me ball back dance? while close up view and change to top view to get good sync of video streams between switches



// next iteration TODO:

[ ] add radar style turning radius with fade to ball position visualization

[ ] make it possible to show data of second ball

[ ] 2 ball bouncing
    [ ] implemented code needed for this
    [ ] might be possible with Continuous2StepBouncingLow
    [ ] add ball 2 ball data
    [ ] add ball 2 ball data visualization
    [ ] bounce A -> just correct B -> just correct A -> bounce B -> just correct A -> just correct B -> bounce A?
    
[ ] add hit position heatmap
[ ] freeze datapoint-stream on ball data used by PID?
[ ] maybe hit ball without upwards motion when the ball moves very fast to get it under control faster.

[ ] maybe add a circleness check and discard detected object with a low circleness 
    Not really needed since there's normally not much noise in the video stream. But it'd be a nice to have.
    Just in case. Or for demos where there's a hand showing.

[ ] make radius result of image processing more precise (results differ from center to edge)

[X] check whether or not the tilt is constant when moving up with tilted plate
    [ ] turns out we DO have a problem with the tilt shifting ever so slightly while moving upwards with a tilted plate

[ ] fix runtime error that occurs when no camera is connected.
[ ] Write latex math file

memo:

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523
