

[ ] fix ball position spawning every frame (bad performance impact)
[X] figure out whether or not velocity data is reliable
[X] change plate to octagon (import new model data).
[X] update CAD data to reflect new plate design.

[ ] fix runtime error that occurs when no camera is connected.
[ ] Write latex math file

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523

memo:

[ ] improve velocity calculation
   [X] gradient descent
   [X] make view for gradient descent
       [x] show both x and y data in the view
       [X] make data points start at 0, not -deltaTime
       [ ] rotate the x data-stream by 90 degrees to make the thing a bit easier to look at.
       [ ] freeze datapoint-stream on data used by PID.
[ ] image processing in Unity?
