[X] overlay image processing image onto custom grayscale image.
[X] display red channel red, green channel green ect.
[X] image processing image switching with "1"
[X] text to explain what kind of image processing we're showing
[X] better key control for image stream switching.
[X] cool moving around startup thingy.
[X] fix model upper joint animation.
[X] add smaller datapoints to see path ball took.
[X] camera circling around machine?
[ ] add FPS counter
[ ] image processing in Unity? or try some other OpenCV algorithms.
[ ] run edge-filter on image data.
[X] figure out whether or not velocity data is reliable
[X] change plate to octagon (import new model data).
[X] update CAD data to reflect new plate design.

[ ] fix runtime error that occurs when no camera is connected.
[ ] Write latex math file

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523
