

[ ] fix ball position spawning every frame (bad performance impact)
[X] figure out whether or not velocity data is reliable
[X] change plate to octagon (import new model data).
[X] update CAD data to reflect new plate design.

[ ] fix runtime error that occurs when no camera is connected.
[ ] Write latex math file

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523

memo:

[ ] off-center bouncing
[ ] show TiltController input target position in gradient descent view
[ ] fallback to PID whenever the ball isn't bouncing to prevent bad analytical controls

[ ] "every bounce will be a bit higher"-bouncing

[ ] circle bouncing with moving PID target

[ ] color tilt visualization red whenever tilt was clamped


[ ] add radar style turning radius with fade to ball position visualization
[ ] add some sort of index of all the things that will be featured in the video.
    show it in full first, than show the current thing only (e.g. "0: flexing")
    -> display current ball control strategy
    
[ ] make the ball position datapoint on bounce a different color for better debugging
    [X] need to first get a better ball bounce detection. The one we got currently is several frames delayed
    
[ ] make it possible to show data of second ball

[X] add Debug.Log message when the tilt is getting capped
[ ] 2 ball bouncing
    [ ] implemented code needed for this
    [ ] might be possible with Continuous2StepBouncingLow
    [ ] add ball 2 ball data
    [ ] add ball 2 ball data visualization
    [ ] bounce A -> just correct B -> just correct A -> bounce B -> just correct A -> just correct B -> bounce A?
    
[ ] add hit position heatmap
[ ] freeze datapoint-stream on ball data used by PID?
[ ] bring ball to halt by catching it softly.
[ ] maybe hit ball without upwards motion when the ball moves very fast to get it under control faster.

[ ] maybe add a circleness check and discard detected object with a low circleness 
    Not really needed since there's normally not much noise in the video stream. But it'd be a nice to have.
    Just in case. Or for demos where there's a hand showing.

[ ] make radius result of image processing more precise (results differ from center to edge)

[X] check whether or not the tilt is constant when moving up with tilted plate
    [ ] turns out we DO have a problem with the tilt shifting ever so slightly while moving upwards with a tilted plate


// vid:
[ ] front view, change to unity graphics, look around, ent up in top view, change to realtime video again (top view)
[ ] start with short flex, then throwing ball onto machine
[ ] get rid of 1 ball by tossing it to the side after doing 2-ball-bouncing for a while
