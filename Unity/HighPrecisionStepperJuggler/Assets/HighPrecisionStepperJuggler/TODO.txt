

[ ] fix ball position spawning every frame (bad performance impact)
[X] figure out whether or not velocity data is reliable
[X] change plate to octagon (import new model data).
[X] update CAD data to reflect new plate design.

[ ] fix runtime error that occurs when no camera is connected.
[ ] Write latex math file

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523

memo:

[X] improve ball detection image processing 
[X] improve velocity calculation
   [X] gradient descent
   [X] make view for gradient descent
       [x] show both x and y data in the view
       [X] make data points start at 0, not -deltaTime
       [X] rotate the x data-stream by 90 degrees to make the thing a bit easier to look at.
[ ] freeze datapoint-stream on data used by PID?
[ ] implement on-collision-with-plate-ball-position-estimation in gradient descent (using moving up time)
[ ] maybe implement some sort of self-learning PID supported algorithm (given speed and position before impact)
[ ] add cross drawing at ball position
[ ] alternating x and y correction
[ ] add visualization for plate tilt to gradient descent view graph.
[ ] bring ball to halt by catching it softly.
[ ] calculate airborne-time from time between sent moveCommands (might be useful?)
[ ] implement shallow bouncing
[ ] implement pixel cluster detection for multiple ball position extraction
[ ] implement erosion and delation to get rid of text on ball?
[ ] lower threshold?



// vid:
[ ] front view, change to unity graphics, look around, ent up in top view, change to realtime video again (top view)
[ ] start with short flex, then throwing ball onto machine
