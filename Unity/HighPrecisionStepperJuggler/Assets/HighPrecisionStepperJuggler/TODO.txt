

[ ] fix ball position spawning every frame (bad performance impact)
[X] figure out whether or not velocity data is reliable
[X] change plate to octagon (import new model data).
[X] update CAD data to reflect new plate design.

[ ] fix runtime error that occurs when no camera is connected.
[ ] Write latex math file

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523

memo:

[X] improve ball detection image processing 
[X] improve velocity calculation
   [X] gradient descent
   [X] make view for gradient descent
       [x] show both x and y data in the view
       [X] make data points start at 0, not -deltaTime
       [X] rotate the x data-stream by 90 degrees to make the thing a bit easier to look at.
[X] move all the image processing into a new class
[X] better ball radius calculation in order to get rid of the influence of black text on orange ball.

[X] add visualization for plate tilt to gradient descent view graph.
[X] correct the tilt visualization in such a way that the calibration value is ignored
[X] smaller serial bus timeout for better responsiveness?

[ ] there might be a problem with how we apply the tilt-offset

[ ] calculate airborne-time from time between sent moveCommands (might be useful?)
[ ] look at ball velocity right after ball hit and use past airborne-time to predict where the ball will be coming down
    Use all this information to get the tilt right on down-movement
    [ ] smaller up/down movement possible with this approach?
    
[ ] circle bouncing with moving PID center

[ ] 2 ball bouncing
    [ ] implemented code needed for this
    
[ ] freeze datapoint-stream on ball data used by PID?
[ ] maybe implement some sort of self-learning PID supported algorithm (given speed and distance from center before impact)
[ ] alternating x and y correction
[ ] velocity correction every bounce but p-correction alternating between x and y
[ ] bring ball to halt by catching it softly.
[ ] implement shallow bouncing
[ ] heatmap of plate hit positions
[ ] try to hit the ball a bit faster now that the plate has become lighter  
[ ] maybe hit ball without upwards motion when the ball moves very fast to get it under control faster.

[ ] maybe add a circleness check and discard detected object with a low circleness 
    Not really needed since there's normally not much noise in the video stream. But it'd be a nice to have.
    Just in case. Or for demos where there's a hand showing.

[ ] implement on-collision-with-plate-ball-position-estimation in gradient descent (using moving up time)
    Seems like a nice to have at this moment in time


// vid:
[ ] front view, change to unity graphics, look around, ent up in top view, change to realtime video again (top view)
[ ] start with short flex, then throwing ball onto machine
